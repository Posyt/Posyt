☐ make sure compose works
☐ make sure cards work
☐ make sure conversations list works
☐ make sure chat works
☐ make sure push works
☐ make sure deep link share works
☐ render an error if facebook login fails - loginWithFacebook.js
☐ add an empty message to conversations list before you've had any matches
☐ Install PushNotificationsIOS and make sure PushNotificationBar works

Android
☐ complete FBSDK install https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk#31-android-project

Eventually
☐ upgrade to RN0.37 - it really breaks the modals though :(
☐ ask for push permission again if denied the first time
  ☐ ask again if the user said yes the the first prompt, but no to the real push prompt

Maybe
☐ swtich node-ddb-client and maybe minimongo-cache out for react-native-meteor
☐ use facebook account kit https://github.com/underscopeio/react-native-facebook-account-kit
